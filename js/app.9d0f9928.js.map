将字符串str从第x开始，y个字符串长度的子串替换为字符串instr LOWER(str) 将字符串str中的所有字母变成小写 UPPER(str) 将字符串str中的所有字母变成大写 LEFT(str,x) 返回字符串最左边的x个字符 RIGHT(str,x) 返回字符串最右边的x个字符 LPAD(str,n,pad) 使用字符串pad对字符串str最左边进行填充，直到长度为n个字符长度 RPAD(str,n,pad) 使用字符串pad对字符串str最右边进行填充，直到长度为n个字符长度 LTRIM(str) 去掉str左边的空格 RTRIM(str) 去掉str右边的空格 REPEAT(str,x) 返回字符串str重复x次的结果 REPLACE(str,a,b) 使用字符串b替换字符串str中所有出现的字符串a STRCMP(str1,str2) 比较字符串str1和str2 TRIM(str) 去掉字符串行头和行尾的空格 SUBSTRING(str,x,y) 返回字符串str中从x位置起y个字符串长度的字符串 2、合并字符串函数CONCAT()和CONCAT_WS() 语法形式： CONCAT(str1,str2,...,strn); 将传入的参数连接起来返回合并的字符串类型数据。如果一个参数为NULL，则返回NULL。 CONCAT_WS(sep,str1,str2,...,strn); 将字符多个字符串连接成一个字符串，字符串之间用分隔符分开。分隔符为NULL时返回NULL，子字符串中含有NULL时，函数将忽略NULL。 3、比较字符串大小函数STRCMP() 语法形式： STRCMP(str1,str2); 比较传入的字符串str1与str2，如果传入的参数str1大于str2，则返回true；如果参数str1小于str2，则返回false；如果参数str1等于str2，则返回0。 4、获取字符串长度函数LENGTH()和字符数函数CHAR_LENGTH() 语法形式： LENGTH(str); 获取传入的字符串str长度。 CHAR_LENGTH(str); 获取传入的字符串str的字符数。 5、实现字母大小写转换函数UPPER()和LOWER() 语法形式： UPPER(str); UCASE(str); 将所传入的字符串str中所有字母转换为大写字母。 LOWER(str); LCASE(str); 将所传入的字符串str中所有字母转换为小写字母。 6、查找字符串 返回字符串位置的FIND_IN_SET()函数 语法形式： FIND_IN_SET(str1,str2); 返回在字符串str2中与str1匹配的字符串的位置。 返回指定字符串位置的FIELD()函数 语法形式： FIELD(str1,str2,str3,...); 返回第一个与字符串匹配的字符串的位置。 返回子字符串相匹配的开始位置 语法形式： LOCATE(str1,str); POSITION(str1 IN str); INSTR(str,str1); 获取子字符串相匹配的开始位置。 返回指定位置的字符串的ELT()函数 ELT(n.str1,str2,...); 获取指定位置的字符串。 选择字符串的MAKE_SET() 语法形式： MAKE_SET(num,str1,str2,..,strn); 将num转换成二进制数，再根据二进制数来选择字符串。从左到右顺序读取该值，二进制数值为1选择该字符串，否则不选该字符串。 7、从现有字符串中截取子字符串 从左边或右边截取子字符串 LEFT(str,num); RIGHT(str,num); 截取指定位置和长度的子字符串 SUBSTRING(str,num,len); MID(str,num,len); 8、去除字符串开始的首位空格 去除字符串开始处的空格 LTRIM(str); 去掉字符串结束处的空格 RTRIM(str); 9、去掉字符串首位空格 TRIM(str); 10、替换字符串 INSERT(str,pos,len,newstr); REPLACE(str,substr,newstr); 分类: Database 好文要顶 关注我 收藏该文 AlphaJunS 粉丝 - 8 关注 - 11 +加关注 10 « 上一篇： properties配置文件 » 下一篇： MySQL中的数值函数 posted @ 2018-11-05 10:43 AlphaJunS
